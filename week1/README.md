# Week 0 - Scratch Project

Title: Learning language with Peter & Jack

Description: For my Week0 CS50 assignment, I created a small interactive game in Scratch. The project uses two sprites: two dinosaurs named Peter & Jack. The game begins with a short discussion between the sprites, after that, the player can interact by answering questions & gaining scores.

Requirements satisfied:

Two sprites: two Dinosaurs.

At least three scripts: Dialogue, movement, and scoring script.

Conditional: The dinosaur asks if the player wants to play; if the answer is “yes,” the game continues, otherwise it ends.

Loop: Used to animate sprite movement with costumes and repeated steps.

Variable: A Score variable tracks the player’s progress.

Custom block: I created a block called walk (steps) that takes an input for the number of steps and animates the dinosaur’s movement smoothly.

Well, I really enjoyed this project. using scratch to make games & animations while using conditionals, loops, variables, and custom blocks was cool.
